## Hey!🙋‍♂️ My name is Brandon Li, and I am an economics and computer science graduate from the University of Chicago 🐦. 

I am passionate about data analytics 🔢 and machine learning 🤖, particularly as it relates to the realm of finance 💸 and sports ⚽, and this portfolio contains a variety of different projects that I've worked on throughout my years as a student and an aspiring coder.
